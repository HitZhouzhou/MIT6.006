# Data Structures and Dynamic Arrays
## Difference between Interface and Data Structure
### Interface
- specification
- what data can store
- what operations are supported and what they mean

### Data Structure
- representation
- how to store
- algorithm to support the solutions

## main interfaces:
- Set:key and value
- sequence:care about a paticular sequence
## main Data Structure approaches
- arrays
- pointer based

## Static sequence interface : maintain a sequence of items
- build()
- len()
- iter_seq()
- get_at()
- set_at

## Solutions (natural):static array
- O(1)
## Key:word RAM model of computation
- memory = array of w-bit words
- array = a consecutive chunk of memory
- array[i] = memory(address(array)+i)

> - Assume w>=log(n)(n is the size of the things we need to operate on)
Why?
Linked lists:  
    x0->x1->x2->...->xn-1

> We can't add a element to a array using O(1)time,because the size of the static array is fixed

## Dynamic arrays(Python lists)
- relax the constraint size 
- enforce size=O(n)
- maintain A[i]=xi

if n = sizze :alloc new array of size:2*size
> we can't add constant to the size,because we will do that frequently.
